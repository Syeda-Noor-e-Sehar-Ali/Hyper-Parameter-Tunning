# Hyper-Parameter-Tunning
Hyperparameter tuning aims to find the best settings for parameters that are set before the model training process:It involves methods like grid search or random search to explore different combinations of these parameters.Validation techniques, such as cross-validation, are used to evaluate each combination's performance on unseen data.
Examples of hyperparameters include the regularization strength in SVMs or the number of layers in neural networks.Optimizing these parameters can significantly improve the model's accuracy and ability to generalize to new data.
